= GraphQL Federation

[NOTE]
The current status is experimental!

Extension library to add support for https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/[GraphQL Federation].

The `api` module defines the directives `@Key`, etc. The `runtime` module hooks into the SmallRye GraphQL events to dynamically enhance the GraphQL schema with the Federation extras (`_Entity`, `_Service`, etc.).

== API

Annotate the type you want to extend with `@Key`, e.g.:

[source,java]
----------
@Key(fields = "id")
public class Film {
    String id;
    String year;
    String name;
    // ...
}
----------

In the service that extends that type, declare a reduced view that only defines the keys, e.g. `id`. Annotate the type as `@Extends` and the field as `@External`, e.g.:

[source,java]
----------
@Extends @Key(fields = "id")
public class Film {
    @External String id;
}
----------

And write a resolver method that adds the fields to that type, just like a 'local' `@Source` resolver would, but use `@FederatedSource` instead, e.g.:

[source,java]
----------
class Reviews {
    public List<Review> reviews(@FederatedSource Film film) {
        //...
    }
}
----------
