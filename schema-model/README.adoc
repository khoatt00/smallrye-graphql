= SmallRye GraphQL Schema Model

This is a representation of a GraphQL Schema. It gets build using Jandex scanning and passed into the implementation to create a executable endpoint.

== Schema

A Schema contains:

- a list of queries, grouped by the class that host them
- a list of mutations, grouped by the class that host them
- a map of interfaces, mapped by classname
- a map of types, mapped by classname
- a map of inputs, mapped by classname
- a map of enums, mapped by classname

=== Reference

During scanning certain object reference other objects that might not have been scanned yet, 
so we always just have reference to that (potentially future) object.

A Reference contains:

- the classname
- the graphql name
- the reference type

=== Reference Type

Enum that indicate the type of object. Valid options are:

- INPUT
- TYPE
- INTERFACE
- ENUM
- SCALAR

=== Root
The Header for all object. It extends reference and get create when one of the underlying concrete classes are create during scanning.
It typically represent a "root" element in the schema (enum/input/type/interface)

It contains:

- all fields from Reference
- a description

=== Enum

A basic entry in the schema that represent an enum. It contains:

- all field from Root
- list of valid values

=== Complex

A complex entry in the schema. Represents Interface, Input and Type. It contains:

- all field from Root
- set of methods (or operations) on the complex type.
- set of source methods (or operations) on the complex type.
- set of interfaces that this complex type implements.

=== Item
An abstract object that has:

- a name
- a description

=== Method

A method (of operation) on a complex object (input/type/interface). It contains:

- all fields from Item
- a return field
- a list of parameters

=== Field

A object that extends Item. It contains:

- all fields from Item
- a optional defaultValue.
- a boolean to indicate that this field is mandatory
- a int to indicate the depth of a collection (0 if not a collection)
- a boolean to indicate that this field is mandatory inside the collection (false if not a collection)
- a reference to the type.
