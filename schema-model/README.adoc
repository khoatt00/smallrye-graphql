= SmallRye GraphQL Schema Model

This is a representation of a GraphQL Schema. It gets build using Jandex scanning and passed into the implementation to create a executable endpoint.

== TODO

- `@Source` annotation scanning
- `@NonNull` for elements inside a collection (TYPE_USE)
- Formatting maybe

== Schema

A Schema contains:

- a list of queries, grouped by the class that host them
- a list of mutations, grouped by the class that host them
- a map of interfaces, mapped by classname
- a map of types, mapped by classname
- a map of inputs, mapped by classname
- a map of enums, mapped by classname

=== Reference

During scanning certain object reference other objects that might not have been scanned yet, 
so we always just have reference to that (potential future) object.

A Reference contains:

- the classname
- the graphql name
- the reference type

=== Reference Type

Enum that indicate the type of object. Valid options are:

- INPUT
- TYPE
- INTERFACE
- ENUM
- SCALAR

=== Root
The Header for all object. It extends reference and get create when one of the underlying concrete classes are create during scanning.
It typically represent a "root" element in the schema (enum/input/type/interface)

It contains:

- all fields from Reference
- a description

=== Enum

A basic entry in the schema that represent an enum. It extends Root and adds:

- list of valid values

=== Complex

A complex entry in the schema. Represents Interface, Input and Type. It extends Root and adds:

- set of methods (or operations) on the complex type.
- set of interfaces that this complex type implements.

=== Method

A method (of operation) on a complex object (input/type/interface). It extends Root and adds:

- a return field
- a list of parameters

=== Field

A abstract object that extends Root and adds:

- a field name
- an optional description
- a boolean to indicate that this field is mandatory
- a boolean to indicate that this field is a collection

=== Return

Represents the return field on a Method. It extends Field and adds:

- a reference to the return type.

=== Parameter

Represents the parameter (of list of) on a Method. It extends Field and adds:

- a reference to the parameter type.
- the defaultValue.
